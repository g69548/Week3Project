    **This is the story from week 2 that im adapting to the week three flowchart so that i dont have to start from scratch.**
    
    You walk into the garage and this time you have your choices between what brand of coil overs
    you would like. With these choices comes pros and cons which are often disputed or reached to
    an agreement by the client asking the mechanic for his or her input on the desicion.
    You will check your original height yet again, this time we are going to have an escape
    from the rest of the code if we are low enough (which we wont be for the sake of the code, but
    the option would be there if we had user input.) Next for the boolen we will look at your
    preference in how low you want to go and the 2 will have a true if it can go that low or a false if it
    cant. Then you will go through and keep lowering it until it gets to a disired height. The
    mechanic will also have a partner helping him and the helper can get tools at certain times during
    th visit. The you will finally check the height and see if you are sitting "Steezy".</p>
